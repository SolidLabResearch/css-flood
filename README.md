# CSS Flood

## What?

A CLI tool to flood a CSS with requests, for testing/benchmarking.

## Why?

To evaluate/test/benchmark the [Community Solid Server (CSS)](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer), we need to generate realistic load on it.

You could use existing tools like [artillery](https://www.artillery.io/) to generate this load, but they are limited in what they can do, and are not made with CSS testing in mind.

This tool has a more limited scope, which allows it to do things artillery can't (easily) do, and to do them with little or no config.

## How?

- `css-flood` uses solid specific and CSS specific authentication, and can read/write this authentication from a cache file. This auth caching can also be done separately, to prepare for later testing.
- `css-flood` will emulate a specific number of users, each doing back-to-back requests. It can either do this for a certain period of time, or a number of requests.
- `css-flood` generates a report when it's done. This report contains the custom statistics.

Fetcher Setup:
  --duration      Total duration (in seconds) of the flood. After this time, no new fetches are done. If this option is
                  used, --fetchCount is ignored.Default: run until all requested fetches are done.              [number]

                           Start) and increment.                                              [boolean] [default: false]

Details for --steps:

css-flood performs one or more steps in a fixed order.
--steps selects which steps run (and which don't).

A lot of these steps are related to the "Authentication Cache".
Note that this cache is not used if authentication is disabled.
How much the authentication cache caches, can also be configured with the --authenticateCache option.
The file used to load/save the authentication cache is controlled by the --authCacheFile option.

The steps that can run are (always in this order):

- loadAC: Load the authentication cache from file.
- fillAC: Perform authentication of all users, which fills the authentication cache.
- validateAC: Check if all entries in the authentication cache are up to date.
              This step causes exit with code 1 if there is at least one cache entry that has expired.
- testRequest: Do 1 request (typically a GET to download a file) for the first user.
               This tests both the data in the authentication cache (adding missing entries), and the actual request.
- testRequests: Do 1 request (typically a GET to download a file) for each users (back-to-back, not in parallel).
                This tests both the data in the authentication cache (adding missing entries), and the actual request.
- saveAC: Save the authentication cache to file.
- flood: Run the actual "flood": generate load on the target CSS by running a number of requests in parallel.

Examples:
--steps 'loadAC,validateAC,flood'
--steps 'fillAC,saveAC'
--steps 'loadAC,fillAC,saveAC'
--steps 'loadAC,testRequest,saveAC,flood'

All steps (makes little sense):
--steps 'loadAC,fillAC,validateAC,testRequest,testRequests,saveAC,flood'
