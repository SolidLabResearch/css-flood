# CSS Flood

## What?

A CLI tool to flood a CSS with requests, for testing/benchmarking.

## Why?

To evaluate/test/benchmark the [Community Solid Server (CSS)](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer), we need to generate realistic load on it.

You could use existing tools like [artillery](https://www.artillery.io/) to generate this load, but they are limited in what they can do, and are not made with CSS testing in mind.

This tool is more specific:
- It uses solid specific and CSS specific authentication, and can read/write this authentication from a cache file. This auth caching can also be done separately, to prepare for later testing.
- This tool will emulate a specific number of users, each doing back-to-back requests. It can either do this for a certain period of time, or a number of requests.
- This tool generates reports with the specific statistics we need.
